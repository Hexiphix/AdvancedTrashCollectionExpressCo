        <p class="parone">Here at Advanced Trash Collection Express Co. we believe that there is a better way to
            collect and manage trash than the old fashioned and archaic means of weekly visits from a large and
            inefficient truck that doesnâ€™t run by the schedule of your garbage. For this reason, we have devised a
            solution for this issue, in the form of advanced technology, that will pick up your trash when you want it
            to, and on a much less strict schedule.</p>
        <div id="trashdrone" role="img" aria-label="Trash Drone"></div>
        <p class="partwo">This new industry offers two new revolutionary advancements in the development of the waste
            management industry, in the form of fully scheduled and automated trash collection drones for smaller
            orders, and all electric smart garbage trucks for larger trash pickups. Both these services use advanced AI
            to create the fastest route possible to fulfill all orders within 4 hours of being scheduled for drone
            orders, and within 24 hours of being scheduled for all smart truck orders.</p>
